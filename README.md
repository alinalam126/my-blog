## Design Decisions
For this project, I tried to adhere to natural gaze patterns. For the landing page, I followed the Z-pattern. I know this starts with some logo in the upper left corner, but I didn't have time to create one. The body of my landing page was inspired by [Sean Halpin's personal site](seanhalpin.io). I used a size hierachy with the titles, and aligned the basic structure of my content to the center of the page. I tried making the page symmetrical in positioning of elements, which creates an order to the page. I also use lines of dots to break up the content into appropriate subcategories. With regards to my color choices, I picked a blue scheme because I think blue is percieved as a nice, neutral, calming color. To make for clearer color contrasts and transitions, I use color gradients when the user hovers and/or clicks on links and buttons. On my portfolio page, I also use a z-pattern and color contrasts to guide the user. One bug I ran into was the placement of my footer. I could not get it to stay at the bottom of the page without fixing its position, which I did not want to do because I thought it was distracting on my landing page.

## Challenge
I built on my foundational HTML and CSS skills. One thing I really tried to experiment with was using CSS Flexbox with positioning my elements. I also experiemnted with building a navbar and carousel from scratch, whereas I only had used Bootstrap before. I wanted to utilize JS, but didn't have the time to play with it and see where it could be used. Also, I learned more about how static site generators work and how useful they can be. I experimented with layouts, and tried to add a blog to my site. However, there are some bugs that have caused the posts page not to render correctly.
